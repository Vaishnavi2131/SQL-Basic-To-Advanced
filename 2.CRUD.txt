 select * from STUDENT;


2.Read:

SELECT * from STUDENT;
SELECT name from STUDENT;
SELECT name,age from STUDENT;
SELECT name,regno,age from STUDENT;

where clause:

SELECT name,age from STUDENT where name="Vaishnavi
";
SELECT name,age from STUDENT where regno=101;

SELECT name,age from STUDENT where regno=rollno;

Alias=as:
This is used when we have rename our column name but it show only present query does not affect on main data.

SELECT name as 'student name',age from STUDENT;

3. Update:

UPDATE STUDENT set name="Sak" where regno=101;

UPDATE STUDENT set name="vaishu" where name="sak";

UPDATE STUDENT set age=21 where age=20;

UPDATE STUDENT set regno=201 where name="Pramod";


4.DELETE:

DELETE FROM STUDENT where rollno=5;

DELETE FROM STUDENT where age=14;

DELETE FROM STUDENT where age=rollno;

DELETE FROM STUDENT;
